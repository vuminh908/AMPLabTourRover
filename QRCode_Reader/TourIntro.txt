Hello, My name is Sparky. 
                                               
I am the Tour Robot for the Autonomous Mastery and Prototyping Lab.

The AMP Lab is a co curricular instructional lab, which means there are no grades or deadlines.

The point of this lab is to let students explore and expand on the concepts taught in classes.

All the projects you see on the table were build by students, and the students get to keep them. 

If you have any questions, please ask the human in the polo, my hearing sensors have not been connected.
