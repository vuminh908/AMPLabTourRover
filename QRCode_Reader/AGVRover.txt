Ah! Here is my Big Brother. The Autonomous Ground Vehicle Project is designed to build from scratch a durable, all terrain capable rover platform. The model before you is the 4th revision. It can carry payloads of up to 200 pounds, has 700 inch pounds of torque, and has a top speed of 4 miles per hour. It is durable enough for people to ride ontop! The items around it are the ground control station and the long range antenna setup.
