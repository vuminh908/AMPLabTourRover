#   Python QTR-8RC sensor library
#   Atuhor: Tom Broughton (@dpolymath)
#   Date: 20/03/2017
#
#   Reads the Pololu QTR-8RC IR sensor array
#   https://www.pololu.com/docs/pdf/0J12/QTR-8x.pdf
#
#   Hardware setup (changing pins can be managed in init):
#   LEDON pin connected to GPIO 21
#   3V3 to Pi GPIO rail and GND (bypass soldered on qtr-8rc for 3V3 option)
#   Pins 22 - 29 to each IR LED/phototransitor pair
#    - This version does not work with PWM for LEDON_PIN
